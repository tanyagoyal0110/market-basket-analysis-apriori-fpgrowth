    "## 1. Frequent Pattern Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "Frequent pattern mining is a data mining technique used to discover patterns, associations, or correlations among items in large datasets.      \n",
    "A very common use case is **market basket analysis**, where each transaction is a “basket” of items (e.g., products bought together in a grocery store).      \n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:**       \n",
    "Find itemsets (combinations of items) that occur **frequently** together in the transactions, and then derive **association rules** such as:          \n",
    "\n",
    "> If a customer buys `X`, they are likely to also buy `Y`.       \n",
    "\n",
    "These patterns can be used for:      \n",
    "- Product placement and store layout\n",
    "- Cross-selling and recommendation systems\n",
    "- Understanding customer behavior\n",
    "- Designing promotions and bundles\n",

    "\n",
    "Apriori is one of the earliest and most well-known algorithms for mining frequent itemsets.        \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1. Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Apriori works in a **bottom-up** (level-wise) manner:       \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find all **frequent 1-itemsets** (single items whose frequency ≥ minimum support).\n",
    "2. Use these to generate **candidate 2-itemsets**, then count their frequency and keep only those that are frequent.\n",
    "3. Use frequent 2-itemsets to generate candidate 3-itemsets, and so on.\n",
    "4. Stop when no more frequent itemsets can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses the **Apriori principle**:       \n",
    "\n",
    "> If an itemset is frequent, then **all of its subsets must also be frequent**.       \n",
    "> Conversely, if an itemset is infrequent, **all supersets of that itemset are also infrequent**.       \n",
    "\n",
    "This principle allows Apriori to **prune** the search space:      \n",
    "- Any candidate itemset that has an infrequent subset can be safely discarded without counting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2. Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:**\n",
    "  - Conceptually simple and easy to understand.\n",
    "  - Good for teaching and small/medium datasets.\n",
    "- **Cons:**\n",
    "  - Generates many candidate itemsets.\n",
    "  - Requires multiple passes over the dataset (one pass per itemset length).\n",
    "  - Can be slow and memory-intensive on larger datasets."

    "## 3. FP-Growth Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "FP-Growth (Frequent Pattern Growth) is a more efficient alternative to Apriori for mining frequent itemsets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1. Basic Idea\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of generating candidate itemsets explicitly, FP-Growth compresses the dataset into a special data structure called an **FP-tree (Frequent Pattern tree)** and mines it directly.         \n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scan the dataset once** to compute the frequency of each item and remove infrequent items.\n",
    "2. **Sort items** in each transaction by descending frequency and build the FP-tree:\n",
    "   - Each path in the tree represents a set of items appearing together in transactions.\n",
    "   - Nodes store item names and counts.\n",
    "3. **Mine the FP-tree recursively** to find frequent itemsets:\n",
    "   - For each item, construct its **conditional pattern base** and build a **conditional FP-tree**.\n",
    "   - From these conditional trees, extract frequent itemsets without generating huge numbers of candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2. Characteristics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pros:**\n",
    "  - Avoids generating all candidate itemsets explicitly.\n",
    "  - Usually much faster than Apriori on larger or denser datasets.\n",
    "  - More efficient in memory usage for many practical problems.\n",
    "- **Cons:**\n",
    "  - More complex to implement and understand compared to Apriori.\n",
    "  - FP-tree may still become large if the dataset is very dense."

    "we have 8 association rules with our filter, the value of kulczynski is < 0.4, it means:         \n",
    "our rules are asymmetric (we have one sided rules)         \n",
    "so the rules are valid in the direction mined (A -> B), but we should'nt consider them as a strong bidirectional relationship.     \n",
    "also jaccard is less than 0.1, it means:        \n",
    "among all transactions containing either the antecedent or the consequent, fewer than 10% contain both together.         \n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    "**conclusion:**          \n",
    "When the antecedent happens, the consequent follows in more than 60% of cases,            \n",
    "and this is at least 30% more likely than what we would expect just by random.         \n",
    "**Kulczynski** values are around 0.3, and **Jaccard** values are below 0.1;         \n",
    "This means these associations are not balanced (they are stronger in one direction) and they do not appear very often in the whole dataset.             \n",
    "Finally, the **Imbalance Ratio (IR)** is above 0.8, which is close to 1.        \n",
    "This shows that the antecedent and consequent have very different support values,          \n",
    "so one itemset is much more frequent than the other, Therefore, the rule is quite imbalanced and asymmetric.        \n",
    "Overall, although the rule has reasonable confidence and a lift above 1,       \n",
    "the low Jaccard and Kulc values and the high IR indicate that the practical strength and usefulness of this rule may be limited.       \n",
    "**Note:** all consequents are 'whole milk' (it has most support in dataset)"

    "### **Explanation:**        \n",
    "we have 8 association rules with our filter, the value of kulczynski is < 0.4, it means:         \n",
    "our rules are asymmetric (we have one sided rules)         \n",
    "so the rules are valid in the direction mined (A -> B), but we should'nt consider them as a strong bidirectional relationship.     \n",
    "also jaccard is less than 0.1, it means:        \n",
    "among all transactions containing either the antecedent or the consequent, fewer than 10% contain both together.         \n",
    "       \n",
    "       \n",
    "**conclusion:**          \n",
    "When the antecedent happens, the consequent follows in more than 60% of cases,            \n",
    "and this is at least 30% more likely than what we would expect just by random.         \n",
    "**Kulczynski** values are around 0.3, and **Jaccard** values are below 0.1;         \n",
    "This means these associations are not balanced (they are stronger in one direction) and they do not appear very often in the whole dataset.          \n",
    "Finally, the **Imbalance Ratio (IR)** is above 0.8, which is close to 1.        \n",
    "This shows that the antecedent and consequent have very different support values,          \n",
    "so one itemset is much more frequent than the other, Therefore, the rule is quite imbalanced and asymmetric.        \n",
    "Overall, although the rule has reasonable confidence and a lift above 1,       \n",
    "the low Jaccard and Kulc values and the high IR indicate that the practical strength and usefulness of this rule may be limited.       \n",
    "**Note:** all consequents are 'whole milk' (it has most support in dataset)"
